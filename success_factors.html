        <h1>Key success factors and design principles</h1>
        <p class="lead">In some countries there were already attempts to standardise both the Production Line and the Platform and some of them failed. From the experience we found that there are these key major points to ensure success:</p>
			</div>
        <div class="container bs-docs-container">
	  <ul>
         <li>Ensure people to use the solution: acceptance, benefit and commitment.</li>
         <li>Ensure people to sell the solution: be proud and show value.</li>
		 <li>Ensure scalability and deployment at SBU level: support and deploy.</li>
      </ul>
	  <p>The following key success factors the made the prosperous approaches successful address those areas.</p>

	    <li>High acceptance</li>

				    <p>Reuse in the minds</p>
				    <p>To overcome the not invented here syndrome is a hard task especially in the engineering and ar-chitecture area where wrong decisions might re-sult in a total catastrophe. So it is relatively clear that we need to convince all decision taking CSD architects that developing a solution using devon helps them instead of driving them into this catas-trophe. </p>

					<p>Both open source software projects and com-mercial ones work with communities where peo-ple help each other better than any development team could do because they really experience the software in the field.</p>
				    <p>This includes (at least indirect) user participation to design the next major releases etc.</p>

					<p>All experience from Germany shows that having a post mortem process gathering information on the solution after the engagement is finished will not succeed. If the people working in the en-gagement do not have the idea that a part of what they are building might be interesting for others we will never see this part. So we must establish a culture of contribution, where people get praised (by the community, their line managers etc.) for contributing</p>

				     <p>Best fit instead of perfect</p>
					 <p>Both elements of CSD 2015 will fail if we do not succeed in convincing people that the solutions chosen support their needs. For the engineering area this holds especially because of the exist-ence of many solutions. So we do not have to go for the perfect solution but for the best fit solution that can be accepted by many engineers and where they can see a real benefit. This holds es-pecially if the solutions are produced by a magic third party not doing real engagement work. </p>
